                I'm a coffee lover and a proud owner of a Gaggia Classic Pro and
                a Eureka Mignon Specialit√°. It's all about that speciality
                coffee shop quality and experience. I regularly have friends
                over for coffee and technical/personal exchange of views. Were
                you ever in the area and would like to drop by, just give me a

                Although I do not own a cat currently, I adore them. I don't
                externalize it much in the form of dressing or accessories, but
                I easily melt whenever I meet one. It's also my spirit animal,
                and this quote from Ernest Hemingway perfectly explains why:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                A cat has absolute emotional honesty: human beings, for one
                reason or another, may hide their feelings, but a cat does not.
              </blockquote>

                I firmly believe that we as a species have lost our way. I love
                technology and I do not think that we should go back to the
                caves, but our thinking has diverged greatly from ways that are
                sustainable, simple and honest. I try to live a minimalistic and
                green lifestyle and encourage my environment to do the same.

                I once heard a quote in a video, but I do not its author:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                All art is a question mark that only you know the answer to.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The biggest question mark in the topic of art for me has always
                been music. In the past, I played the piano, the guitar and the
                drums for varying amounts of time. I listen to many different
                genres, most notably classical, modern symphonic, indie, IDM and
                ambient. For me, music has been a focusing tool for many years:
                if not for work, then for reflections.
